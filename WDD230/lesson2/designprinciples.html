             <h2> Hick's Law: Kia Website</h2>
             <img src="../images/kia.png" alt="Kia Website">
             <p> I chose this Website because I really like the layout that Kia used here. Imagining all of the Specs and Models of all cars made by Kia, they used a really good job for user simplicity. They have a search bar at the top which is really nice to pinpoint what you are looking for. They also have a toolbar on the top right with Dealers and Offers to main a couple. If you wanted to just scroll and enjoy the Site, it is very organized. You will see featured Cars and can see the Specs through that and can click into the Button with learning more information on that Car. So, it is very organized and is not filled with all kinds of buttons and lists of unending cars. Here is the Website: <a href="https://www.kia.com/us/en"> Kia Website</a></a></p>

             <h2> White Space and Clean Design: Xbox Website</h2>
             <img src="../images/xbox.png" alt="Xbox Website">
             <p> I chose this Website because it looks very clean and visually appealing. Xbox uses multiple Colors that really go together. They break up their Elements into little columns on the left and right sides, each going over different sections. There is a White line across the screen in the middle and this is really the most important part because that is where you can decipher where you want to go in the Site, whether it be Consoles, Game Pass, or Accessories. You can see that their is a lot of White Space around this very important section of the Website, and that Space really creates organization and easy-to-use steps for the user. Xbox uses a lot of lighter Colors in their Design which creates Space by itself. Looking at this Website really is appealing.

             <h2> Fitt's Law: Apple Website</h2>
             <img src="../images/apple.png" alt="Apple Website">
             <p> This Website really incorporates the Fitt's Law because they use 2 big hyperlinks right in the front and center of the Site. You have a Learn More and an Order in the middle of the page. It is one of the first things you see. Using this law really increases the number of times users Order and Learn More wheras they put those hyperlinks at the bottom where the users might not see them. They also have a very clean toolbar at the top that you can use the buttons for navigating throughout the Website. Having these buttons right on the front of the Site is using this law. Check it out here: <a href="https://www.apple.com/"> Apple Website</a></a></p>
