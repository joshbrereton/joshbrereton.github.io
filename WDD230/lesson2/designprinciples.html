             <h2> Hick's Law: Kia Website</h2>
             <img src="../images/kia.png" alt="Kia Website">
             <p> I chose this Website because I really like the layout that Kia used here. Imagining all of the Specs and Models of all cars made by Kia, they used a really good job for user simplicity. They have a search bar at the top which is really nice to pinpoint what you are looking for. They also have a toolbar on the top right with Dealers and Offers to main a couple. If you wanted to just scroll and enjoy the Site, it is very organized. You will see featured Cars and can see the Specs through that and can click into the Button with learning more information on that Car. So, it is very organized and is not filled with all kinds of buttons and lists of unending cars.</p>
