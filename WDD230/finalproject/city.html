        <h2>Information about Salt Lake City, Utah</h2>
        <p>Let's first talk about the Historical data of Salt Lake. I have found the following information on this Website: <a href="https://utah.com/salt-lake-city/history"> Click here for more information! </a>"Salt Lake City was founded on July 24, 1847, by a group of Mormon pioneers. (Mormons are members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.)" July 24th is a Holiday in this City because of this fact. This Website also goes more into the History of the Early Settlers of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints and how they were in search of a land where they could practice their Religion freely and not be persecuted. Utah's State Bird is the Seagull because "In 1848, more emigrants came to the valley. But a late frost, drought, and a plague of crickets nearly destroyed the harvest. Flocks of seagulls consumed the crickets and enough of the crop was saved to enable the settlers to survive the winter of 1848-49." From this Website we also learn about how the Utah State Symbol is the Beehive because in 1848 a Treaty was signed to have this Land be a part of the United States, and in 1850 the "State of Deseret" became the Utah Territory. Deseret means honeybee, a symbol of industriousness." We see this industriousness throughout the years through Buildings that were made. The Salt Palace was made, Streets were erected and also in 2002, the Olympics was held in Utah.</p>
        <p>Now, let's talk about the Demographic information of Salt Lake. In the following Website, <a href="https://datausa.io/profile/geo/salt-lake-city-ut/#:~:text=The%205%20largest%20ethnic%20groups,%2DHispanic)%20(2.66%25).">Click here</a>, we gain some more information. Though this is around 2017-2018, it can still be informative. We learn the median income: "In 2018, Salt Lake City, UT had a population of 196k people with a median age of 32 and a median household income of $56,370." We also see how Utah has grown in that year from 2017-2018: "grew from 194,188 to 195,701, a 0.779% increase and its median household income grew from $54,009 to $56,370, a 4.37% increase." Next, we learn about the Ethnicity group percentage: "The 5 largest ethnic groups in Salt Lake City, UT are White (Non-Hispanic) (65.4%), Other (Hispanic) (12.7%), White (Hispanic) (7.65%), Asian (Non-Hispanic) (5.26%), and Two+ (Non-Hispanic) (2.66%). 0% of the households in Salt Lake City, UT speak a non-English language at home as their primary language, and 88.5% of the residents in Salt Lake City, UT are U.S. citizens."
