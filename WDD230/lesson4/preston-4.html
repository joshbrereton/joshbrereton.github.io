            <p> Welcome to my Website designated for those that love, live, and breathe Idaho. As you can see, my logo of the Site is a Gem because Idaho is the Gem State! I have made this Website so that those living and doing activities in Idaho (and out) can find Sports clothing, food sales, and weather updates for conveniency. This Website will help those that are parents and young adults that are living and caring for their own and also for their families. They will be able to see the best deals at local stores. It is also for those that are into College and High School Football and Basketball and will include updates from their games. This is not all, it will also provide necessary family time, as we show the weather and give an activity that can be done on that day due to the weather that can improve their going out activites/family night! Here are some scenerios that can be used in our Site: What is the weather for the next 3 days? I need to buy some University of Idaho Shorts! Where can I go to get the best deal on Steak that I am going to buy for my Birthday? What is the Score of my son's High School Football game? What activity can we do for Family Night this week?<p>
